# Guidelines for file2img
## First Step
You can use scripts including `excel2pdf`, `ppt2pdf`, `word2pdf` to convert the corresponding file types to PDF files. 
## Second Step
After converting the files to PDF, you can use `pdf2img` to convert the PDF files to images.

# Notice
We don't find a good way to convert `excel`, `ppt` and `word` files to images on `Linux` and `MacOS`, so the methods we provide are based on `Windows`. If you have a better way to convert these files to images on `Linux` and `MacOS`, please let us know.
